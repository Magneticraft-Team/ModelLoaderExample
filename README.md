# ModelLoader example mod
Example mod showing hot to use ModelLoader from Java

There are 4 examples:
- Using a gltf model defined in a blockstate file for a block
- Using a gltf model registered directly for a block
- Using fast TESR model for a TileEntity
- Using and animated model for a TileEntity

Note: this is not an example of a good mod structure, I avoided any automation and optimization mechanism
to make the code simpler and easier to understand.

If you find a bug or typo, make an issue.
